**Category** : Forensic
**Points** : 100

During the operation of the enterprise's IT system, the SOC team suspected that a database server was attacked. You (tier 2 personnel) are assigned to analyze a file (db_attack_capture.pcap) that has previously recorded network traffic. Let's try to analyze and answer the following question: At the 19th line in the pcap file, what is the content of a query that the attacker has entered?

Flag format: `FUSec{*query*}`

Example: query: ```1’ or 1=1```
=>  ```FUSec{1’ or 1=1}```
